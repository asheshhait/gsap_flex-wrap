# ðŸŒŸ GSAP Flex-Grow Image Hover Gallery

This project is part of my **30 Days of GSAP Challenge** â€“ Day XX.  
It showcases an elegant image gallery where each image **expands on hover** using the powerful combination of **Flexbox and GSAP animations**.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS (Flexbox Layout)
- JavaScript
- [GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)](https://greensock.com/gsap/)

## ðŸŽ¯ Features
- **Five interactive images** in a horizontal layout.
- On hover, the hovered image smoothly **grows in width** while the others shrink.
- Uses **GSAP's `.to()` animation** method to dynamically update the `flex-grow` property.
- Responsive layout with clean and minimal styling.
## ðŸš€ How It Works
- All five images are placed inside a flex container.
- Each image is given an initial `flex-grow: 1`.
- On hover, the selected image animates to `flex-grow: 5` (or any desired scale), while others shrink.
- GSAP handles smooth transitions without jank or layout shifts.

## ðŸ“… Part of the Series
This is **Day 10 ** of my self-imposed **30 Days of GSAP Challenge**.  
Stay tuned for more animations every day!
